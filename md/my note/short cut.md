# Short Cut

rfc
- Good for traditional/vanilla function components
- Common in class-based to function refactors
  
rafc
- Good for modern JS/TS usage
- Keeps things concise

rafce
- Same as rafc but includes export default right away
- Saves you from manually writing the export

Use rafce for best with typescript
