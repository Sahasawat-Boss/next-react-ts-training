# JSX
It's recommended to use .jsx instead of .js for your React/Next.js pages and components because:

1. Clear Developer Intention
- This file contains JSX (JavaScript + XML syntax)!

2. Better Editor/IDE Support
- Give better syntax highlighting
- Improve JSX autocomplete
- Provide smarter error checking

3. Avoids Conflicts in Mixed Codebases
- Regular .js files (like config, utilities, etc.)
- JSX-based files (components/pages)

Naming them .jsx helps keep things organized and prevents confusion â€” especially in larger teams or projects.
